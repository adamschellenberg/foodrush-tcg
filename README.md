# Untitled Action TCG Game For Plauydate
A trading card game-esque (minus the trading) game for Playdate with an active-time-battle-inspired battle system.

Collect 100 cards across 3 in-game unlockable card sets and create a 20 card deck that best suits you! Use your deck to battle against a gauntlet of rivals and become the very best, like no one ever was!

### Collect
Use Shop Points earned in The Gauntlet and Casual Play to buy 3-card booster packs from the local Card Shop to build up your collection. There are three expansion sets to unlock, totaling 100 cards to collect! Flip through your binder and show off your collection to your family and friends! (And gloat to Steven from 4th grade who ALWAYS seemed to have the rare card you could just never seem to pull. Take THAT, STEVEN!)

### Customize
Build 20-card decks best suited for your desired playstyle. Make a super-powered deck to lay waste to those who dare challenge you, or build a deck with only standard-level cards and really challenge yourself. All play styles are welcome here, just have fun! Save multiple decks to suit your mood!

### Compete
Try out your new deck in Casual Play and see how you can improve against various difficulties of opponents. You can even use a completely broken deck that doesn't follow any of the Gauntlet rules, like a deck of all over-powered-level cards, or 20 of the same card. Just be careful, your opponent can do the same thing (if you turn on the "Play By No One's Rules" mode)! There's always another local who basks in the chaos, just like you!

When you feel brave, take on The Gauntlet, a series of back-to-back battles of increasing difficulty. Can you beat them all and prove that you are the best gamer to ever live?

Whether Casual Play or The Gauntlet, earn some Shop Points every time you play! These points can be used at the Card Shop to buy more cards, in a lovely, totally-not-addicted cycle!
